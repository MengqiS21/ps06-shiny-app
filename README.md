# Introduction
DataL [80 cereal data] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals)

# What I did in the app.R
This dataset is about the cereal dataset. Collected from Kaggle. The dataset includes the nutritional content of cereal from various cereal brands in the U.S., as well as their respective ratings. Provides users with a reference for choosing cereal in the future.
In this app people can select the cereal companies they want to view and then get a visual graph of the nutritional content of these cereals. Also can view only the data in the data table.
